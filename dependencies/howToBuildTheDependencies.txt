Step 1 - Download BuildTools.jar from https://hub.spigotmc.org/jenkins/job/BuildTools/ and put it in a folder
Step 2 - Run BuildTools.jar with "java -jar BuildTools.jar".  I think you need git for this
Step 3 - There will be a file named craftbukkit<version>.jar in the newly created spigot folder
Step 4 - Right click on the ctf project folder in eclipse, click properties, java build path, libraries, add external jar. Select craftbukkit<version>.jar
Step 5 - Download TagApi https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/1-8-nametags-integrated-api.3724/updates Add it as an external jar
Step 5 - Get maven for eclipse.  Good luck!
Step 6 - Clone the Spigot Api from https://github.com/SpigotMC/Spigot-API
Step 7 - Create a new maven project in eclipse and select the newly cloned repository as the workspace
Step 8 - Right click on the project, click run as -> Maven install.  Hopefully this will create a spigot-api jar file.  Add this as an external jar to the ctf project.
Now you are done building the dependencies!  Have a nice day!
