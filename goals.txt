Hi, I'm forking this because I'm going to try to add stuff to it.
This is my first time using github, I'm just forking it because I think that's how it works.

The first thing I'll do is read and comment your code to figure out what exactly it does.
But after that, I want to make some changes.

Goals:
Making "computer players", mobs that are on the other team when there are not enough players to do real CTF.
Making more classes and balancing them more.
//TODO add more goals

Thanks,
Alexander Puckhaber
